# vendor/geos notes

This directory contains GEOS C API headers, which are an artifact of running `cmake` in `src/geos`.

Remember: these headers must be updated each time the git submodule for `src/geos`
is updated to a new release tag.

TODO: add vendor.sh script to make convenient running of cmake and copying headers into here.
